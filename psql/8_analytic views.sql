Each row = one incident / operation / seizure report made by a brigade under a given IDD and DR.

So this table captures quantitative seizures and contextual info:

üìç Geographic location

üßç Organizational hierarchy (DR ‚Üí IDD ‚Üí Brigade)

üïí Temporal data (month, year, date, hour)

‚öñÔ∏è Quantities of goods seized

üî´ Weapons, drugs, fuel, etc.
