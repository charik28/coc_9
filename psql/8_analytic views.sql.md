Excellent direction üëè ‚Äî this is the kind of thinking that transforms a data table into an **intelligence layer**.
Let‚Äôs go step by step:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Recall the full **DDL** of your operational data table,
2Ô∏è‚É£ Then identify **strategic materialized or analytic views** that can extract new insights ‚Äî useful for **map visualization**, **dashboards**, **trend detection**, and **alerts**.

## üß± 1Ô∏è‚É£ Table DDL ‚Äî `rend25.rendement`

```sql
CREATE TABLE rend25.rendement (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    mois            VARCHAR(10),
    annee           INT,
    dr              VARCHAR(50),
    idd             VARCHAR(50),
    brigade         VARCHAR,
    wilaya          VARCHAR(100),
    collab          VARCHAR(255),
    loc_e           NUMERIC(10, 6),
    loc_n           NUMERIC(10, 6),
    topo            VARCHAR(255),
    "date"          TIMESTAMP,

    tab_kg          NUMERIC(12, 2),
    alc_l           NUMERIC(12, 2),
    carb_l          NUMERIC(12, 2),

);
```

## üß≠ 2Ô∏è‚É£ What This Data Represents

Each row = one **incident / operation / seizure report** made by a brigade under a given *IDD* and *DR*.

So this table captures **quantitative seizures** and **contextual info**:

* üìç Geographic location
* üßç Organizational hierarchy (DR ‚Üí IDD ‚Üí Brigade)
* üïí Temporal data (month, year, date, hour)
* ‚öñÔ∏è Quantities of goods seized
* üî´ Weapons, drugs, fuel, etc.

---

## üßÆ 3Ô∏è‚É£ What Views Can Be Derived?

We can extract **at least 6 families of analytical views**, depending on what questions you want answered.

---

### üß© A. Organizational & Spatial Hierarchies

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `vw_org_filters`

üëâ Filters for UI (we already defined it):

```sql

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW rend25.vw_org_filters AS
SELECT dr, idd, brigade, r.wilaya,w.latitude,w.longitude
FROM rend25_rendement r
         join coc10.wilaya_coords w on r.wilaya like w.wilaya
--WHERE dr IS NOT NULL AND idd IS NOT NULL AND brigade IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY dr, idd, brigade;

--389

select * from rend25.vw_org_filters;


```

üß† **Use:** Filter dropdowns / organizational hierarchy.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è B. Geographic Intelligence

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `vw_map_summary`

Summarize each brigade‚Äôs total seizures + location.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW rend25.vw_map_summary AS
SELECT
    dr,
    idd,
    brigade,
    wilaya,
    AVG(loc_n) AS lat,
    AVG(loc_e) AS lng,
    SUM(kif_kg) AS kif_total,
    SUM(coc_kg) AS coc_total,
    SUM(tab_kg) AS tabac_total,
    SUM(carb_l) AS carburant_total,
    SUM(armes_u) AS armes_total
FROM rend25.rendement
GROUP BY dr, idd, brigade, wilaya;

select * from rend25.vw_map_summary;

```

üß† **Use:**

* Map markers sized by total seizures
* Choropleth maps per wilaya
* "Hot zones" detection

---

### üìà C. Temporal Trends

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `vw_monthly_trends`

Aggregated per month/year & DR.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW rend25.vw_monthly_trends AS
SELECT
    annee,
    mois,
    dr,
    SUM(kif_kg) AS kif_total,
    SUM(coc_kg) AS coc_total,
    SUM(psy_compr) AS psychotropes_total,
    SUM(carb_l) AS carburant_total,

FROM rend25.rendement
GROUP BY annee, mois, dr
ORDER BY annee, mois, dr;

select * from rend25.vw_monthly_trends; -- 135 row

```

üß† **Use:**

* Monthly chart trends (line charts, bars)
* Detect spikes in specific substances
* Compare DRs by month

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è D. Risk & Alert Indicators

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `vw_risk_score`

Compute a **synthetic risk score** based on weighted factors.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW rend25.vw_risk_score AS
SELECT
    dr,
    idd,
    brigade,
    wilaya,
    COUNT(*) AS incidents,
    SUM(kif_kg + coc_kg + (psy_compr / 1000.0)) AS drug_index,
    SUM(carb_l / 1000.0) AS fuel_index,
    SUM(armes_u) AS weapons_index,
    (
        COALESCE(SUM(kif_kg),0) * 0.4 +
        COALESCE(SUM(carb_l)/1000,0) * 0.3 +
        COALESCE(SUM(armes_u),0) * 0.2 +
        COUNT(*) * 0.1
    ) AS risk_score
FROM rend25.rendement
GROUP BY dr, idd, brigade, wilaya
ORDER BY risk_score DESC;

select * from rend25.vw_risk_score ;--396

```

üß† **Use:**

### üìä E. Collaboration Efficiency

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `vw_collaboration_effectiveness`

Measure how often a collaboration leads to large seizures.

```sql
-- drop materialized view rend25.vw_collaboration_effectiveness;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW rend25.vw_collaboration_effectiveness AS
SELECT
    collab,
    COUNT(*) AS operations,
    SUM(kif_kg + coc_kg + tab_kg + carb_l)::numeric(15,4) AS total_goods,
    AVG(kif_kg + coc_kg + tab_kg + carb_l)::numeric(15,4) AS avg_goods

WHERE collab IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY collab
ORDER BY total_goods DESC;


select * from rend25.vw_collaboration_effectiveness;

## üöÄ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Bonus: Automated Refresh

If you want all views to refresh nightly:

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rend25.vw_org_filters;
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rend25.vw_map_summary;
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rend25.vw_monthly_trends;
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rend25.vw_risk_score;
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rend25.vw_collaboration_effectiveness;
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rend25.vw_goods_summary;
END $$;
```

Or in **cron**:

```
0 3 * * * psql -d mydb -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW rend25.vw_risk_score;"
```

---

Would you like me to propose a **Grafana dashboard layout (panels + queries)** directly based on these new views?
It would show, for example:

* Top 10 brigades by risk
* Map with dynamic clustering
* Trend of drug seizures over months
* Collaboration ranking
